## 💡 Problem Statement

In today’s digital age, with an overwhelming volume of books available online, users struggle to find titles that match their unique tastes. This project proposes a **machine learning-based recommendation engine** that automatically filters and recommends books based on individual user behavior, keyword queries, and rating data.

---

## 📊 Dataset Overview

- **Inputs:**
  - Book Name
  - Description
  - Genre
  - Year of Publication
  - Author
  - Price
  - User Ratings

- **Preprocessing:**
  - Handling missing values
  - Feature extraction from text descriptions
  - Encoding categorical variables
  - Normalization

- **Source:** Collected from multiple online platforms and structured into a CSV file.

## 🧠 Recommendation Algorithms

### 🔹 Content-Based Filtering

- Analyzes book attributes (genre, author, description) and user preferences.
- Uses **TF-IDF Vectorization** + **Cosine Similarity** to recommend similar books.

### 🔹 Collaborative Filtering

- Recommends books based on user behavior and similarity in ratings.
- Utilizes a **user-item rating matrix** and computes similarities across users.

### 🔹 Keyword-Based Filtering

- Takes user-input keywords (genre, author, themes) and filters matching books.
- Works well for cold-start scenarios or user-defined searches.
